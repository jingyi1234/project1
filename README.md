### Overview
My idea is targeting the teenagers. Making sure the people who does not know how to adopt and take care of the pets correctly. The popular pets are puppies, kittens and rabbits. I will design by combining humanâ€™s favorite cakes and candies, with their favorite toys, food, and places to play to help pets to choose what is right for them. At the end, proving that you are a qualified host.
